# ROADMAP / TODO — tGBP/wstGBP v4 backstop hook

Durable backlog so nothing is lost across context clears. Keep this in sync as work lands.
See `CLAUDE.md` for the full design; this file is just status + what's left.

Status: `[x]` done · `[ ]` todo · `[~]` partial/in-progress

## Decision (2026-06-03): ship the pure backstop, defer the hybrid

Only **one** hook goes to external audit / mainnet, and it is **`WstGBPBackstopHook`** (pure backstop,
LP blocked). Rationale: it delivers the full product (infinite depth, tight ~25bps band) with a far
smaller audit surface, and best-execution against any *separate* third-party LP pool is handled at the
routing layer (Uniswap routing / UniswapX + arbitrage pinning a vanilla pool into the band) rather than
inside the hook. The `WstGBPHybridHook` (+ `WstGBPHybridQuoter` + its tests) — fully built, fixed
(M-01/L-01), and fork-validated — was removed from the tree and **preserved in git history at commit
`b7a5c5a`**; revive it only if in-pool LP demand materializes (it would need its own audit). Audit scope
is in `AUDIT_SCOPE.md`. This resolves the P2 item (6) consolidation question below.

## Done

- [x] **Hook (shipped): `src/WstGBPBackstopHook.sol`** (flags `0x888`) — pure backstop, LP blocked,
      ownerless + no capital, exact-in/out both directions, sharing the router + quoter.
      - A `WstGBPHybridHook` (flags `0x88`, best-ex: in-band LP first then backstop) was also built but is
        now **deferred and removed from the tree** (see the Decision note above; preserved at `b7a5c5a`).
- [x] Vendored `src/base/BaseHook.sol` (this periphery pin dropped `BaseHook`).
- [x] `src/interfaces/IwstGBP.sol`.
- [x] Settle-first periphery router — `src/periphery/WstGBPSwapRouter.sol` (exact-in/out,
      minOut/maxIn/deadline/recipient, surplus refund).
- [x] Quoter — `src/periphery/WstGBPQuoter.sol`: backstop quotes + `previewSwap` executability.
      Off-chain formula in `CLAUDE.md`.
- [x] **LP-aware quoter (deferred with the hybrid)** — `src/periphery/WstGBPHybridQuoter.sol` replayed
      v4's `Pool.swap` to the backstop edge + priced the residual at the oracle (exact hybrid blend,
      fuzz-validated). Removed from the tree with the hybrid; preserved at `b7a5c5a`.
- [x] Deploy script — `script/DeployHook.s.sol`: CREATE2-mines the backstop flags `0x888`, pool init
      fee 0 / tickSpacing 1, deploys router + quoter, and asserts the hook's cached `act`/`pip` feed
      proxies equal the wrapper's (I-02).
- [x] Mainnet-fork tests (29): `test/WstGBPBackstopHook.t.sol` — pricing, router hardening + Permit2,
      quoter + `previewSwap`, guards, capacity (L-02), cached-feed parity (I-02), swap-first rejection.
      (The hybrid's suite was removed with the hybrid; preserved at `b7a5c5a`.)

## Design invariants (do NOT regress without a deliberate decision)

- **Settle-first only.** `beforeSwap` runs before the taker pays, so input must be pre-settled into
  the PoolManager. Stock swap-then-settle routers are unsupported by design.
- **No hook buffer, no owner.** The hook wraps the swap's own tokens; it never holds inventory or
  privileged roles. (We removed an earlier ERC-6909 buffer + owner/sweep on purpose.)
- **No extra hook fee.** The 25bps spread is the wrapper's; the hook is a pass-through.
- currency0 = tGBP, currency1 = wstGBP; flags = `0x888`.

## Backlog (prioritized)

### P1 — Integration layer (needed before bots can use it)

- [x] **Quoting.** `WstGBPQuoter` (on-chain, exact, with `previewSwap` executability) + off-chain
      formula documented in `CLAUDE.md`. Tests assert quote == execution for all four modes.
- [x] **Harden `WstGBPSwapRouter`**: split into `swapExactInput` (enforces `minAmountOut`) /
      `swapExactOutput` (enforces `maxAmountIn`, refunds surplus); both take `deadline` + `recipient`
      (`address(0)` ⇒ `msg.sender`). Tested: minOut, maxIn, deadline, recipient, surplus refund.
      - [x] Permit2 entrypoints — `swapExactInputPermit2`/`swapExactOutputPermit2` (SignatureTransfer;
            payer signs a `PermitTransferFrom`, no router approval). Fork-tested vs the approval path.
- [x] **Deploy the router (and quoter)** from `script/DeployHook.s.sol`.

### P2 — M2: best-execution across third-party LP + backstop (the "hybrid")

Requirement (clarified by user, 2026-05-30): the pool may hold third-party LP at ANY range
(full-range, wide, narrow). A swap must get **best execution**: consume LP that beats the backstop
edge first, then backstop the remainder at the edge (mintcost for buys / burncost for sells). LP
priced worse than the current edge is never used (the backstop is always ≥ as good), and gets arbed
back into the band by the backstop itself. The comparison is against the *current* (NAV-drifting)
edge, not a fixed band — so it self-corrects as the rate moves out of where LP was placed.

  Example: mintcost 1.0013, burncost 0.9988. Buyer of 100k wstGBP with 30k LP at 1.000–1.0010 fills
  30k from LP then mints 70k at 1.0013. If that LP were at 1.0020 (> mintcost) it's ignored.

- [ ] **Mechanism** (two viable, decide at build):
      (a) settle-first router sets `sqrtPriceLimitX96` = backstop edge; hook backstops the unfilled
          remainder in `afterSwap` (needs afterSwap + afterSwapReturnDelta flags); or
      (b) reentrancy-guarded nested `poolManager.swap` to the edge in `beforeSwap`, then backstop the
          residual.
      Either way: enable LP adds (drop the beforeAddLiquidity revert); **skip the AMM entirely when
      the pool price is already past the edge** (else `Pool.swap` reverts `PriceLimitAlreadyExceeded`
      — check `slot0` first). New flag set ⇒ new mined hook address (immutable ⇒ fresh deploy). With
      LP reserves now in the PoolManager, revisit whether swap-first routing/quoting partially works.
- [x] **Decided (2026-05-30):** *combine* (best execution — fill better-than-edge LP first, then
      backstop the remainder in the same swap) and *charge a pool fee* (LPs earn it on the portion
      they fill).
- [ ] **Mechanism choice:** hook-internal combine via reentrancy-guarded **nested `poolManager.swap`
      in `beforeSwap`** (preferred over router-side combine, so ANY settle-first router gets
      best-ex). The real AMM runs for the in-band portion (so the pool fee accrues to LPs normally),
      bounded at the **fee-adjusted edge**: for the swapper's all-in price to never exceed the
      backstop edge, the AMM price limit must be `mintcost*(1-fee)` (buys) / `burncost/(1-fee)`
      (sells), converted to `sqrtPriceX96`. Then backstop the residual via mint/redeem and combine
      deltas into the outer `BeforeSwapDelta`. Read `slot0` first; if price is already past the edge,
      skip the AMM entirely (nested swap would revert `PriceLimitAlreadyExceeded`).
- [x] **(1)** `src/WstGBPHybridHook.sol` — new hook, flags `0x88` (LP enabled, no add-revert),
      non-zero pool fee, reentrancy-guarded nested-swap combine + fee-adjusted edge.
- [x] **(2)** Exact-input combine + fork tests (`test/WstGBPHybridHook.t.sol`): buy & sell blend
      in-band LP then backstop, beat pure-backstop price, move pool price toward the edge, hook left
      clean. Exact-output reverts (guarded).
- [x] **(3)** Exact-output combine (buy & sell): partial AMM fill + backstop the remaining output,
      input rounded up with surplus refunded by the router. Fork-tested (blended input beats pure
      backstop).
- [x] **(4)** Edge/guard tests for the hybrid (10 hybrid fork tests total): zero-LP ⇒ exact
      pure-backstop price; price past edge ⇒ AMM skipped + out-of-band LP ignored + price unchanged;
      large swap ⇒ deep blend then backstop; LP earns the pool fee (feeGrowth increases);
      market-closed + underfunded reverts. Hybrid now has full test parity with M1 + LP.
- [x] **(5)** Deploy script + quoter for the hybrid — `WstGBPHybridQuoter` (LP-aware, exact: replays
      the AMM to the edge via `StateLibrary` + backstops the residual) is deployed alongside the hybrid
      in `script/DeployHook.s.sol`.
- [x] **(6) Consolidation — RESOLVED (2026-06-03).** Chose the **pure backstop** (see the Decision note
      at the top). The hybrid hook/quoter/tests were removed from the tree (preserved at `b7a5c5a`); the
      deploy script now deploys only the backstop. Revisit the hybrid only if in-pool LP demand materializes.

Design note — "inject mint/redeem at the tick edges": that IS the backstop conceptually (infinite
liquidity at the mintcost/burncost ticks), but v4 can't post infinite liquidity as a static position
(a tick's depth = its `L`), so it must be synthesized by the hook. Alternative mechanism to the
nested swap: let the real outer swap run bounded at the edge (router sets the price limit) and
backstop the overflow in `afterSwap` — simpler hook, but each integrating router must compute/set the
edge, so best-ex is no longer automatic for arbitrary settle-first callers.

### P3 — Test gaps

- [x] `capacity()`-exceeded revert path (`test_buyRevertsWhenCapacityExceeded` + quoter flag).
- [x] Quoter == execution tests (4 modes) + `previewSwap` executability flags.
- [x] Fuzz pricing/rounding across amounts (backstop quoter == execution, hook-clean, dust ≤ 1 wei) +
      hybrid LP-quote == execution fuzz.
- [x] Large-swap blend (`test_lpQuoteMatchesExecution_largeBuy`, `test_largeSwapBlendsDeepThenBackstops`);
      sell depth guarded by `WrapperUnderfunded` + `RedeemUnderpaid`.

### P4 — Nice to have

- [x] Integrator events — `WstGBPSwapRouter` emits `Swap(payer, recipient, poolId, zeroForOne,
      amountIn, amountOut)` once per swap (all four entrypoints), beyond the PoolManager's own `Swap`.
- [x] Security review / audit prep pass — done (reports under `~/.claude/plans/`).
      Fixed F1 (`RedeemUnderpaid` + cooldown handling: hybrid sells fall back to LP, backstop reverts;
      router enforces exact-output full delivery). Trust model documented in `README.md` (F4).
- [x] Second deep-dive (charge-only-what's-filled): fixed the hybrid **sub-threshold residual** edges.
      EXACT-IN now refunds the un-wrappable dust (`_backstopExactIn` returns `inConsumed`; `_beforeSwap`
      bills `ammIn + inConsumed`) instead of charging the full input for zero output. EXACT-OUT reverts
      `BackstopResidualTooSmall` instead of clamping the input up to `mintcost`/`WAD` and overcharging
      (which had made the hybrid *worse* than the pure backstop and left ~1 token of locked dust in the
      hook). The hook now keeps no dust on these paths; `WstGBPHybridQuoter` mirrors both (exact-in is a
      lower bound, `quoteExactOutput` reverts, `previewSwap` flags `"residual below wrapper threshold"`).
      Regression tests added to `test/WstGBPHybridHook.t.sol`. Low/info items deferred to external audit:
      hook doesn't pin `fee`/`tickSpacing`, no `beforeInitialize` guard,
      `_edgeSqrtPrice` double-floor, exact-out capacity 1-wei window.
- [x] **Gas-optimization pass (2026-05-31)** — all 58 tests still green, pricing byte-identical
      (`quote == execution` parity + round-trip tests unchanged):
      - Both hooks now read the backstop price **directly off the wrapper's immutable feeds**
        (`act.mintcost(pip.read())` / `act.burncost(pip.read())` / `act.cooldown()`) instead of
        `wrapper.mintcost()`/`burncost()`/`cooldown()`, skipping the MaseerOne dispatch hop. `act`/`pip`
        are `immutable` in MaseerOne, fetched once in each constructor and cached as immutables ⇒
        byte-identical to the wrapper facade (`mint`/`redeem` use the same feeds). New
        `src/interfaces/IMaseerFeeds.sol`; `IwstGBP` gained `act()`/`pip()` getters; quoters left on the
        facade (off-chain; same value ⇒ parity preserved).
      - Backstop sell-exact-out deduped (was reading `burncost()` twice); hybrid reads the direction's
        cost **once per swap** and threads it into `_edgeSqrtPrice`/`_backstopExactIn`/`_backstopExactOut`
        (now take a `cost` param; `_edgeSqrtPrice` is `pure`).
      - Hybrid `_inNestedSwap` reentrancy guard is now `bool private transient` (EIP-1153) ⇒ the hook
        holds **zero persistent storage**. Required bumping `solc_version` 0.8.26 → **0.8.28** (evm stays
        `cancun`); v4 deps compile fine (forge compiles the one exact-`0.8.26`-pinned dep in its own unit).
      - `via_ir=true` measured a real **-193,800 gas (-1.210%)** whole-suite, all 58 tests green. Since
        fork-test totals are dominated by *unchanged* mainnet external calls, that -1.21% is
        concentrated in our own contract code. **Decision (user):** flipped the default profile to
        `via_ir = true` (slower compiles, always-optimized bytecode). `.gas-snapshot` baseline (58
        entries, committed-able) regenerated at `via_ir=true`.
- [x] **Security-audit fixes (2026-05-31, `SECURITY_AUDIT.md`)** — all 62 tests green (58 prior + 4
      new regressions across the 3 findings; each mutation-checked to fail on the pre-fix code):
      - **M-01 (Med):** the hybrid AMM edge now nets out the **full directional swap fee** v4 charges
        (LP fee + any pool protocol fee), not just `key.fee`. `WstGBPHybridHook._beforeSwap` reads
        slot0's `protocolFee`/`lpFee` once, derives the combined `swapFee` (`ProtocolFeeLibrary`), and
        feeds it to `_edgeSqrtPrice` (and threads the already-read `sqrtP` into `_fillAmm`).
        `WstGBPHybridQuoter` mirrors it via a shared `_edgeFor`. Stops the nested AMM consuming LP
        priced worse than the backstop when a protocol fee is enabled. No-op when `protocolFee == 0`.
      - **L-01 (Low):** dynamic-fee (`0x800000`) and `>=100%` fee keys now revert `PoolNotSupported`
        in the hook and quoter (`key.fee >= PIPS`, plus a combined `swapFee >= PIPS` guard) instead of
        underflowing / dividing by zero in the edge math. Normal static fees (5bps, 30bps) unaffected.
      - **L-02 (Low):** `WstGBPQuoter.previewSwap` capacity check now uses the **minted** amount
        (`amountIn·1e18/mintcost`), which for an exact-output buy is `>=` the requested output, instead
        of the requested output — closing a false `executable=true` at the capacity boundary.
      - Informational items (I-01..I-05: canonical-PoolKey docs, cached-feed monitoring, `ffi=false`,
        submodule pin, exact-in dust-past-edge) deferred to a follow-up / the external audit.
- [~] **I-04 — pin/record dependency provenance.** No release tag yet ships the required periphery APIs,
      so the audited commits are **documented** in `AUDIT_SCOPE.md` instead: `lib/v4-periphery` at
      `363226d` (heads/main), nested `lib/v4-core` at `v4.0.0` (`59d3ecf5`). Re-pin to a tagged release
      once one supports the APIs. (Repo is now under git, so a future re-pin is straightforward.)
